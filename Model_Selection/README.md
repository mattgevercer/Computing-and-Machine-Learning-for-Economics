Two algorithms for finding the best linear predictors of a dependent variable. I test both algorithms on a dataset that predicts average housing prices for census blocks. 
For assignment description and details on the algorithms, see [7. Model Selection Assignment.pdf](https://github.com/mattgevercer/Computing-and-Machine-Learning-for-Economics/files/7638228/7.Model.Selection.Assignment.pdf)
